**Problem Statement:**

Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

**Results:**

This project culminates in a thorough analysis of energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. Through rigorous examination, we have identified key trends, evaluated the effectiveness of conservation efforts, and pinpointed areas for improvement within the BPS landscape. By harnessing data-driven insights, this analysis serves as a foundation for informed decision-making and the formulation of targeted strategies aimed at achieving climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.
